# Honey Wheat Rolls
---
## Ingredients
- 1 Cup Water
- 1 Teaspoon Salt
- ¼ Cup Honey
- 1 Egg
- 3 ¼ Cups Flour
  - I use 1 ¼ cups of white flour and 2 cups of whole wheat flour
- 2 Teaspoons Yeast

## Instructions
1. Use dough setting on breadmaker (#13, 1:30 min) to make dough.
2. Shape into rolls and place in **greased pan**. Let it rise for 30 minutes covered by a towel.
3. Bake in 350°F oven for 20-25 minutes. Longer time for larger rolls.

**How to rise:**
Set oven at 190°F but turn it off after ≈5 minutes (so oven doesn't actually get to 190°F). Put rolls in oven covered by towel for 30 minutes.

_Note: take rolls out after rising and wait until oven hits 350°F before putting them back in._
