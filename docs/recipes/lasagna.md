**For Oven:**

Preheat oven to 350°F

1. Spray a 9 x 13-inch dish with cooking spray.
2. Spread a small amount of pasta sauce over the bottom of the dish.
3. Cover with lasagna noodles.
4. Spread half of the meat mixture over the noodles.
5. Cover with ½ of the sauce and half of the water.
6. Cover with ½ of the ricotta mixture.
7. Repeat using the rest of the noodles, sauce, meat and cheese mixture.

Cover with aluminum foil that has been sprayed with cooking spray so that it does not stick to the cheese.

Bake 1 hour. Remove foil and bake about 10 minutes more until bubbly and slightly browned on top.
