# Peanut Butter Cookies
---
## Ingredients
- 1 Cup Peanut Butter
  - Chunky or creamy
- 1 Cup Brown Sugar
- 1 Egg
  - Slightly beaten
- 1 teaspoon Baking Soda
- 1 Cup (6 Oz) Chocolate Chips
  - Semisweet

## Instructions
Preheat oven to 350Â°F.

1. In a medium bowl, beat together peanut butter, brown sugar, egg, and baking soda until the mixture is smooth and well-blended.
2. Stir in chocolate chips until evenly distributed.
3. Drop teaspoonfuls of slightly rounded dough onto **un**greased baking sheets. Space the mounds about 2 inches apart.

Bake about 10 minutes until the cookies are puffed and slightly golden, but still soft to the touch.

Let them cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
