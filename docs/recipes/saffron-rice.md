# Saffron Rice
---
## Ingredients
- ¼ Teaspoon Saffron
- ¼ Cup Water
  - Hot
- ¾ Cup Onion
  - Minced
- 2 Cups Basmati Rice
- 3 Cups Chicken Broth
  - 3 cups of water with 3 teaspoons of Better Than Bullion
- ¾ Teaspoon Salt

## Instructions
1. Take ⅛ teaspoon of saffron threads and put them in a spice mortar. Grind the spice with a pestle to a powdery consistency. Add the other ⅛ teaspoon of threads, but do not crush them.
2. Pour ¼ of hot water into the mortar. Let all the saffron soak for 5 minutes. This will open up the flavor of the spice.
3. Meanwhile, rinse the basmati rice in a colander and drain.
4. In a large pot, heat extra virgin olive oil over medium. Sauté the minced onion for about 10 minutes, until the onion is soft and begins to caramelize.
5. Add rinsed rice to the pot and sauté for one minute longer, mixing the rice together with the cooked onion.
6. Pour the yellow soaked saffron liquid evenly across the top of the rice.
7. Add the chicken broth and salt to the rice mixture.

**If cooking on the stove:**
1. Bring rice to a boil, stir. Bring back to a boil for 30 seconds.
2. Cover the pot and reduce heat to low. Let the rice cook for 20 minutes.
3. Turn off the heat, but keep pot covered, and continue to let the rice sit and steam in the covered pot for 10 minutes longer.

**If cooking in an Instant Pot:**
1. Add a little extra water for the pressure cook.
2. Cook in the `Rice` setting on low for 4 minutes.
3. Let the rice cool for 10 minutes, then release the remaining steam.

Fluff the rice with a fork before serving, stirring well to break the rice and incorporate the cooked onion.
