# Unleavened Tortillas
---
## Ingredients
- 2 Cups Flour
  - White or whole wheat
- ½ teaspoon Salt
- 3 ½ teaspoons Butter
- ¾ Cup Milk
- ½ teaspoon Olive Oil
  - For cooking

## Instructions
1. Heat butter and milk together until butter is just melted (on stove or in microwave).
2. Combine flour, salt, butter, and milk.
3. Sprinkle work surface with flour, then knead dough ball for a few minutes until smooth (_doesn't need much kneading_). Add extra flour if dough is too sticky.
4. Wrap dough ball with cling wrap and rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.
5. Cut dough into 4 pieces, roll into balls, then roll out into about ⅛" thick rounds.
6. Heat olive oil in pan at medium heat (_or lower for an iron skillet_).
7. Place one tortilla in the pan and cook for about 1 to 1 ½ minutes. Tortilla should bubble up. Then flip and cook the other side, pressing down if it puffs up. (_There should be smallish golden brown spots on both sides._)
8. Stack the cooked tortillas and keep wrapped with a tea towel. (_The moisture helps soften the surface._)

**Notes:**
1. Higher heat + thinner dough = crispier crust
2. Dough keeps in the refrigerator for around 3 days
